Optimized a bit for LuaJIT 2.

Default paths:
	In my case, I have this folder as "E:\dev\luabind". LuaJIT is located at "E:\dev\luajit". I move generated binaries of LuaJIT to "E:\dev\luajit\bin".
	(Look at file INSTALL.png)
	Compiled files are in "E:\dev\luabind\bin" subdirectories(depends on selected configuration).
	Recommended: build all configurations, in order to fast switch your main project to different configurations.
	"luabind" directory - is like "include" dir. It contains headers, that you must include into search paths of your project.
